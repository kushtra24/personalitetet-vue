  "INTJintro":"<p>It's lonely at the top, but being one of the rarest and most strategically skilled personalities, INTJs understand this. INTJs make up only two percent of the population, and females with this personality type are especially rare, making up only 0.8% of the population—it's often a challenge for them to find like-minded people who are able to push themselves with intellectualism. ruthless and chess maneuvers. People with this personality type are imaginative but determined, ambitious but private, extremely curious but don't waste their energy unnecessarily.<br />With a natural thirst for knowledge that emerges from childhood, INTJs are often given the title 'book enthusiast' as a child. Although their peers aim to insult them, INTJs begin to identify with this and are even proud, enjoying the wide and deep trunk of their knowledge. INTJs also like to share what they know with others, confident in their knowledge of certain subjects, but because of their Intuitive (N) and Judging (J) qualities they prefer to create and implement a great plan within their field instead of sharing their opinions as if they were gossip.</p> <blockquote> <p><br />“You don't have the right to free thought. You have the right to an informed opinion. No one has the right to be ignorant.”<br />Harlan Ellison</p></blockquote> <p><br />Paradoxically to many others, INTJs are able to live with the contradictions of big ones which, however, make a lot of sense - at least if we look at them from a rational perspective. For example, INTJs are both the most optimistic idealists and the greatest cynics at the same time, a seemingly impossible combination. But this is because INTJs believe that with effort, intelligence and interest, nothing is impossible while at the same time they believe that people are only interested in personal gain, too lazy and short-sighted to achieve these results fantastic. Still, the cynical view of reality hardly stops an interested INTJ from achieving the result they believe is important.</p> <p><br /><strong>In matters of principle, stand firm</strong> <br />INTJs radiate confidence and an aura of mystery, and their insightful observations, original ideas, and astonishing logic enable them to make a difference through willpower and force of personality. At times, it seems like INTJs have a tendency to break down and reconstruct every idea or system they come across, giving a sense of perfectionism and even morality. Anyone who doesn't have the talent to keep up with the INTJ's processes, or worse, if they don't see their importance, is likely to lose their respect immediately and forever.<br />Rules, restrictions, and traditions are curse for INTJs - everything must be open to doubt and re-evaluation and if they see any way INTJs will act unpleasantly to realize their ideas and methods which are technically better, sometimes insensitive and almost always non-conformist.<br />This should not be mistaken for urgency- INTJs will try to stay rational no matter how attractive the end goal may seem. Every idea, regardless of whether it was born from within or came from outside, must pass the relentless and permanent 'will this work?' filter. This mechanism applies every time, to everything and everyone, and it causes INTJs a problem.</p> <p><br /><strong>A person reflects more if they travel alone</strong><br />INTJ -are brilliant and confident in their wealth of knowledge that they have acquired over time, but unfortunately the social side is unlikely to be one of those issues. Small lies, simple, meaningless talk are too difficult for a type who suffers for authenticity and depth, but INTJs can go so far as to see social norms as silly. Ironically, it's often best for them to stay where they're comfortable—away from the limelight—where INTJs' natural self-confidence prevails, while working with familiar things they can serve as their own leaders, attracting people with common temperaments or interests, romantically or otherwise.<br />INTJs are defined by their tendency to move through life as if it were a giant chessboard, moving the pieces with care and intelligence, always using new tactics, strategies and potential plans, constantly outsmarting their peers in order to maintain control of a situation while increasing their freedom of movement. This is not to say that INTJs act without conscience, but for many Feeling (F) types, INTJs' reluctance to act on feelings makes it appear that way, and this explains why many fictitious criminals (and misunderstood heroine) are created in this type of personality.</p>",
  "INTJweaknessAndForces":"<h2>INTJ Strengths and Weaknesses</h2><p><br />Quick, imaginative, and strategically minded- INTJs pride themselves on their minds, seizing &ccedil;any chance to increase their knowledge and this shows the power and flexibility of their strategic thinking. Insatiably curious and always up for an intellectual challenge, INTJs can see things from many points of view. INTJs do not use their creativity and imagination for artistic work, but to plan possibilities and courses of action for &ccedil;any possible scenarios.<br />High Confidence- INTJs trust their rationality more than anything else, so that when they reach a conclusion, they have no reason to doubt their findings. This creates an honest and direct communication style that is not held back by social expectations or roles. When INTJs are right, they're right, and no amount of political trickery will change that fact—whether it's to improve a person, a process, or themselves, they choose no other path.<br /> Independent and decisive - this creativity, self-confidence and logic come together to form people who are masters of themselves and take responsibility for their actions. INTJs are not impressed by authority figures, nor are social norms and traditions. No matter how famous someone is, if they have a better idea, INTJs will go up against anyone who just needs to change that thing. Either an idea is completely rational or it is wrong and INTJs will apply this to their arguments as well as their behavior, remaining calm and detached from these sometimes emotionally charged conflicts. INTJs will only be affected by those who follow their rule.<br />Hardworking and determined- if something piques their interest, INTJs can be surprisingly dedicated to their work, spent hours and great efforts to realize an idea. INTJs are extremely resourceful, and if the tasks meet the criterion of further purpose, they will find a way to consolidate and complete those tasks. However, this desire for efficiency can lead to a kind of laziness, where INTJs find ways to skip over things that seem unnecessary and don't seem to require a great deal of thought—this can be dangerous. since sometimes double-checking things is not an unnecessary rule.<br />Open-minded- all this rationalism &ccedil;s into an intellectually perceptive personality type, since INTJs stay open to new ideas, based on logic, even if (and especially if) they prove the INTJs' earlier thoughts wrong. When faced with unknown places, like&ccedil; are different lifestyles, INTJs use their ability to understand things and their independence as well as their dislike of rules and traditions, which results in liberal social sentiments.<br />Experts in many fields, experts in none- their open-mindedness, determination, independence, self-confidence and strategic skills create people who are ready to do &ccedil;anything they want. Able to analyze &ccedil;everything life throws at them, INTJs have the ability to use the basic methodology of almost all systems and apply these concepts wherever needed. INTJs tend to choose professions ranging from IT architects to genius politicians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Weaknesses of INTJs</strong><br /> Arrogant-INTJs are perfectly capable of inflating their self-confidence, mistakenly believing that they have solved all the relevant problems of an issue and closing themselves off to the opinions of those they believe to be intellectually superior. low. Combined with their disregard for social norms, INTJs can be wildly insensitive about making their opinions clear to others.<br />Judgmental - INTJs tend to have complete faith in their process. of thinking, because rational arguments are almost always correct - at least in theory. In practice, emotional factors and history are very influential and the weakness of INTJs is that they consider these factors and the individuals who embrace them as illogical, not examining them and considering their supporters trapped in a low level of thought, making it impossible to be heard.<br />Highly analytical- a recurring theme with INTJs is their analytical ability, but this strength can turn into a weakness where logic does not lead- as&ccedil; it is with human connections. When their critical minds and sometimes level of neurotic perfectionism (as is often the case with turbulent INTJs) are applied to other people and beyond.",
  "INTJrelationships":"<h2>INTJs&nbsp;Feelings</h2><p>INTJs are characterized by self-confidence, logic and extraordinary decision-making, but all this hides a weak point - their feelings. The very idea of expressing feelings is synonymous with irrationality and weakness for many INTJs, a representation of a lack of self-control and short-sightedness that can hardly withstand the harsh light of factual truth.<br />This distrust of feelings is understandable, since feeling (Feeling-F) is the least developed trait in INTJs - like &ccedil;any complicated tool, trained hands can use it to extraordinary effect, while untrained ones do menial work. clumsy and dangerous.<br />People with the INTJ personality pride themselves on being able to remain rational and logical at all times, considering honest and direct information to be more supreme than euphemism and banality in almost any situation. However, in many ways, these qualities of self-restraint and detachment are not the weapons of truth as&ccedil; they appear on the outside, but they are the shields created to protect the inner feelings that INTJs feel. Indeed, because their feelings are such a poorly developed tool, INTJs often feel them more strongly than many significantly more sensitive types because they simply haven't learned how to properly control them.< br />This is a challenging pattern for INTJs to manage especially the younger and more turbulent types who are already less confident than they would like to appear. These feelings are at odds with the idea that INTJs have of themselves as perfect examples of logic and wisdom, and may go so far as to pretend that they have no feelings at all. This does not mean that people with this personality type should be seen as, or even aspire to be, cold-blooded and unfeeling geniuses who live by the rule that feelings are for the weak. INTJs need to understand that this is not true and never will be.<br />More mature and assertive INTJs find more appropriate ways to manage their feelings. Although they will never feel comfortable displaying their feelings in public, INTJs can learn to use them, to steer them toward their logic that helps INTJs to achieve their goals. Although it seems counterintuitive, this can be achieved in many ways.<br />First, INTJs are goal-oriented, with long-term ideas based on logic. When something causes them an emotional reaction, good or bad, that energy can be used as an impetus to advance their goals, helping rational and predetermined plans. Second, feelings are figurative canaries in a coal mine, proving that something is wrong even though I still can't see the logic. These feelings can help INTJs use their logic to ask questions they haven't remembered to ask: &ldquo;That's disturbing. Why? &Ccedil;what needs to be done to fix it?&rdquo;</p><p>In this way, INTJs' feelings are not the way to address a decision, but more of a sign than a decision to address. The Reason (T) trait of INTJs plays the role of the protective older sibling to the Feeling (F) trait—noticing that something has disturbed the weaker sibling, he springs into action, letting logic do the talking and solve the issue instead of complaining about the consequences.<br />However, there comes a time when logic is simply the wrong tool for a given job, where there is no rational solution to a problem, and in these situations INTJ -must use their feelings (Feeling-F) openly. It would be good for INTJs to practice from time to time or at least be aware because try as they might it is impossible to separate feelings from the decision making process. it's a fact that INTJs feel deeply, and that makes them better, not worse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>INTJ Connections</h2><p> <br />In romance, people with the INTJ personality approach things the same way as&ccedil; they do in almost any situation: they design a series of calculated actions with a predictable and desirable end goal - a healthy, long-term relationship. Instead of falling head over heels in the storm of passion and romance, INTJs identify potential partners who meet predetermined criteria, turn the dating process into a series of scoreboards, and proceed to execute the plan with unprecedented precision. <br />In a rational world, this is a method that never fails- but in reality, it ignores important details that INTJs tend to prematurely overlook, such as&ccedil; it's human nature. INTJs are brilliant intellectuals, creating a world in their minds theirs which is more perfect than reality. People who enter this world must fit this fantasy, and it can be extremely difficult for INTJs to find someone up to the task. It goes without saying that finding the right partner is the biggest challenge most INTJs will face.<br />Feeling, tradition, and emotion are INTJs' weak points. They see social norms as&ccedil; it is gentility as stupidity, even humility. The problem is that these rates are designed as a way to moderate notifications and make connections, to manage opportunities, the basics of personal connections. INTJs' penchant for friendly frankness in word and deed can violate this social rule, making dating very difficult for them.<br />As they mature, INTJs will begin to see these factors as important, including rhythm and the emotional part in their plans. But in the meantime it can be especially dangerous for turbulent INTJs - especially if they are hit too many times they may come to the conclusion that everyone is simply irrational, or simply inferior to them intellectually. If cynicism starts to take its toll, INTJs can end up falling into the trap of deliberately exhibiting intellectual arrogance, making solitude their choice.<br />The upside of &ldquo;surrendering&rdquo; of INTJs is that they are most attractive when they are not trying to be, while working in an environment they are used to, where their confidence and intelligence can be seen in action. Letting others come to them is often INTJs' best strategy, and if they smell an opportunity for connection, they will spare no effort to develop and maintain long-term stability and satisfaction.<br />Over time As the relationship grows, INTJ partners will find an imaginative and enthusiastic companion who will share their world and at the same time give them a great deal of freedom and confidence. While INTJs may never be comfortable expressing their feelings and spend more time talking about intimacy than engaging in it, you can always count on them to think of a win-win solution. in &ccedil;any &ccedil;issue.<br />INTJs seek strong and deep connections and trust their wisdom and logic to make sure their partner is satisfied both intellectually and physically.<br />But when it comes to emotional satisfaction, INTJs are simply out of their element. Not all partners enjoy as&ccedil; INTJs tend to view conflicts and emotional needs as puzzles that need to be analyzed and solved. Sometimes emotions need to be expressed because you just need to, and putting &ccedil;every outburst under a magnifying glass is not always helpful. If this becomes a habit, or INTJs think it can be done, they are able to simply end the relationship rather than drag things out.<br />Truth and Morality<br />INTJs are extremely deep and intelligent people who bring stability and insight to their romantic relationships. They value honesty, open communication, and all aspects of a relationship are open to discussion and change, but it should be a two-way street. INTJs do what they think is right and this can often come across as cold- it's important to know that INTJs don't make these decisions lightly. They spend extraordinary amounts of time and energy trying to understand how and why things go wrong, especially if they have committed themselves to the relationship, and of course they are deeply hurt when things go wrong.<br />it is a challenge to find a partner who share the same values - although Intuitive (N) types are uncommon, they can be essential for many INTJs as sharing this quality creates an immediate sense of mutual belonging. Have one or two balancing qualities like&ccedil; are Extroversion (E), Feeling (F), or Seeking (P) can help keep a relationship alive and directed toward growth by keeping INTJs involved with other people, in touch with their feelings, and open to other possibilities.</p>",
  "INTJfriends":"<h2>INTJs as Friends</h2><p>People with the INTJ personality tend to be more successful in forming friendships than they are in romantic relationships, but they still suffer from many of the same obstacles, replacing the processes rational for emotional support. This intellectual distance tends to work both ways, making INTJs difficult to understand and recognize as well as making them unwilling to understand anyone they feel is not on the same level as them. it&rsquo;s often impossible to overcome these obstacles without the kind of instant connection enabled by those possessing the iNtuitive (N) trait.<br />INTJs tend to have fixed opinions about what &ccedil;does function, &ccedil There is no, they are looking for &ccedil;there and for &ccedil;no. These discriminating tastes seem arrogant, but INTJs simply respond that it is a basic filtering mechanism that allows them to direct their attention where it will be best. In reality, socially, INTJs seek an intellectual soulmate more than anything else, and those who aren't prepared for that kind of connection are just plain boring. INTJs need to share ideas - and a gossip circle about mutual friends is not the kind of social life for them.<br />INTJs will keep in touch with only a few close friends, avoiding circles greater kinship in favor of depth and quality.<br />Furthermore, having more than a few friends would compromise an INTJ's sense of independence and complacency—they willingly give up companionship to ensure this freedom. INTJs apply this idea even to those who fit into their social norms, demanding little attention and service to keep company and fostering the same independence in their peers.<br />When it comes to emotional support, INTJs are far from comfortable. They constantly suppress their feelings with shields of rationality and logic and expect their friends to do the same. When emotional situations arise, INTJs may have no idea how to deal with them appropriately, a stark contrast to their capacity for self-restraint and assertive self-direction.<br />But societies are &ccedil;muara<br />However, when they are in their comfort zone, among people they know and respect, INTJs have no problem relaxing and enjoying themselves. Their sarcasm and dark humor are not for the faint of heart, nor for those who have trouble reading between the lines, but for those who understand these INTJs find them to be fantastic story tellers. This pretty much limits their friend group, leaving them with Analysts and Diplomats since the Sensory (S) type's preference for more direct communication often leaves both parties irritated.<br />It's not easy to become. good friend with INTJs. More than the traditions of a social guide or taking part in each other's routine, INTJs have demanding intellectual skills, uncompromising honesty, and a desire to grow and learn as independent individuals. INTJs are talented, intelligent, and development-oriented, and they expect and support their peers to have the same attitude. &Ccedil;anyone who fails to meet these will be described as boring - &ccedil;anyone who meets these requirements will appreciate them, creating a powerful and motivating company that will stand the test of time. </p>",
  "INTJparents":"<h2>INTJs as Parents</h2><p>Being a parent, like many other relationships, is quite a challenge for INTJs. Being so focused on rational thought, logic, and cause-and-effect analysis, INTJs are often unprepared to deal with someone who hasn't developed these skills and can't just walk away. Fortunately, INTJs are especially capable of committing to a long-term project, especially one as meaningful as parenting, with all the intellectual strength they can muster.</p><p>I hope our wisdom will grow with our power…<br />First and foremost, parenting INTJs are very likely to never be able to provide the kind of warmth and caress expected of parents. INTJs are rational, perfectionistic, often insensitive, and certainly not inclined to physically show their love - it will take a full and conscious effort to curb and adapt these qualities to the needs of children, especially in the early years. beginning. If they have an extremely sensitive child, INTJs run the risk of inadvertently suppressing those feelings or coming across as cold and uncaring. <br />Even less sensitive children will need emotional support from time to time, especially as they approach adolescence - INTJs, more than other Analytical types, have trouble managing their feelings in a healthy way let alone others. As a result, INTJs tend to avoid 'unproductive' emotional support, and instead adopt a problem-solving-only attitude. And this is where INTJs are the best—they discuss a dilemma in order to find the unseen triggers and develop a plan to solve the problem at its core.<br />However INTJs do not tell children what to do- they encourage them, make them use their minds to come to the same, or even better, conclusions.<br />INTJs also know that life is often the best teacher and will try to be as liberal as possible, allowing their children to have their own adventures and make their own decisions, further developing critical thinking skills. This does not mean that INTJ parents are gentle - far from it - rather, they expect their children to use their independence responsibly, and often the weight of this responsibility is enough to establish general rules. However when needed, INTJ parents will communicate openly and honestly with their children, believing that knowing the truth is better than not knowing, or even worse being wrong.<br />…And it teaches us that the less we use our power, the greater it will become.<br />If their children are receptive to this approach, INTJ parents will find themselves respected and trusted. INTJs are great communicators when they want to and will present problems as opportunities for personal growth, helping their children develop their own rational thinking and independent problem-solving skills that will apply to the situation. increasingly complex as they grow, increasing their confidence as they forge their way forward. The ultimate goal of INTJ parents is to make sure that their children are prepared to face whatever life throws their way.<br />This is all the effort of the INTJ philosophy of self-direction and in this so they try to make their children like them, working to create capable adults who can continue to use their minds and help their children when the time comes. INTJs understand that this cannot happen if they protect their children from everything evil and harmful, but believe that if they give their children the right tools, they will not need protection. </p>",
  "INTJprofession":"<h2>INTJs in the Profession</h2><p>Professional skill is often the field in which INTJs excel the most. Their capacity to absorb difficult and complex theories and principles and turn them into clear, actionable ideas and strategies surpasses any other type. INTJs are able to filter through the noise of a situation, identifying the main thread that needs to be pulled to untangle others so that they can be restored to their surprisingly simple functions.<br / >The real challenge for INTJs is that in order for their innovative ideas to be heard (and to the less astute, it seems counter-intuitive), they need someone to listen and create a warm rapport. dealing with authoritative people is not one of INTJ's strong points. Early in their careers, INTJs will often suffer from simple tasks and repeated rejections as they develop their skills into clear skills that speak for themselves.<br />INTJs will often find ways to how to automate routine and simple tasks and as time progresses, self-confidence, commitment and natural creative intelligence will open doors to the complexity and freedom they desire.<br />INTJs like to work alone or mostly mostly with small groups where they can maximize their creativity and concentration without constant interruptions from peer questions or meetings with supervisors. For this reason, INTJs are unlikely to find themselves in strictly administrative roles or anything that requires constant conversations and teamwork. Rather, INTJs prefer 'loner' positions such as mechanical or programming engineers, lawyers, or consultants. They only accept capable leaders who help them in these goals and reject the authority of those who hesitate.<br />Their independent attitude and relentless demand for skill means that INTJs absolutely loathe those who get ahead by less means. meritorious such as relatives and political connections. INTJs have particularly high standards, and if they see a colleague or supervisor as incompetent and useless, their respect will be lost immediately and forever. INTJs value initiative, determination, resourcefulness, and dedication, and believe that everyone should complete their work to the highest possible standard.<br />As their careers progress and their fame grows, so will to develop the complexity of tasks and projects of INTJs. They seek progress and development, new challenges and theories, and often fulfill these by entering more active strategic positions. While they don't mind the limelight, INTJs like to be in control of their ideas and will often move into lower but influential roles such as project managers, engineers, marketing strategists, systems analysts, or military strategists.< br />Indeed, INTJs' vision, creativity, and ability to complete these plans gives them the opportunity to succeed in almost any profession that requires them to think about what they are doing. While some professions, such as low-wage and human resources, do not clearly tap into their strengths, INTJs are able to carve out a comfortable place in almost any institution, including their own, in which they make up their minds.</p>",
  "INTJworkPlace":"<h2>INTJs in the Workplace</h2><p>More than anything else, INTJs want to be able to tackle intellectually interesting work with the minimum of outside interference, no less and no more. . Time-consuming management techniques such as trust-building tricks, progress meetings, and protracted sandwich critiques will all bore INTJs—all they want as subordinates, colleagues, or managers. is to dedicate themselves to their goals with the highest standards of technical excellence and to be surrounded by people who share the same values.<br />This makes them seem like exemplary workers and in many ways they are. , but there are many types, especially those who share the combination of Sensing (S) and Feeling (F) traits who will find working (or any other kind of relationship) with INTJs extremely challenging. INTJs have a pretty strict leadership code when it comes to their work, and if they see their colleagues valuing social activities and 'good enough' work over absolute perfection then problems will arise. For this reason, INTJs prefer to work in small groups and with like-minded people - just one person if necessary.<br />INTJs as subordinates<br />INTJs are people of independent and can quickly become irritated if they find themselves in defined positions that limit their freedom. Under the guidance of a liberal manager, INTJs will elevate themselves to positions of expertise, completing their work not out of ambition for promotion but because they deserve it. INTJs look for and value decisive, logical managers who are able to lead skillfully, provide criticism when necessary, and draw those decisions with sound reason.<br />Remember that here INTJs' expectations are being defined for their managers and not the other way around as is the case with some other personalities. Titles are of no importance to INTJs—trust and respect are earned, and INTJs expect it to be a two-way street, giving and receiving advice, criticism, and results. INTJs expect their managers to be intelligent and strong enough to be able to handle this pattern. A silent INTJ conveys more disrespect than all their challenges ever will.</p><p><strong>INTJs as Colleagues</strong><br />Active teamwork is not something good for people with the INTJ personality - fiercely independent and private, INTJs use their resourceful minds and quick wits to avoid conversations with others, work pressure, and create situations where they are not deterred by less intelligent methods, less capable and less adaptable. Instead they are able to joke around by making them read between the lines and let them get on with the job that would be so much easier if they had listened to the advice of INTJs.<br />INTJs are excellent analysts and are able to gather a small group of loyal colleagues to include in their meetings, excluding those who are too detailed or who have not yet earned the respect of INTJs. But INTJs are more likely to take their own initiative- They like to take advantage of challenges and responsibilities, and their perfectionism and determination usually mean that the work comes out clean and useful, giving INTJs the dual satisfaction of solitude and victory. </p><p><strong>INTJs as Managers</strong><br />Although they will be surprised to hear it, INTJs are natural leaders and it shows in their leadership style. INTJs value innovation and efficiency more than any other quality, and will happily set aside hierarchy, protocol, and even their own beliefs if presented with rational arguments for why things need to change. INTJs support freedom and flexibility in the workplace, preferring to engage their subordinates as equals, respecting and rewarding initiatives, and adapting a management strategy of 'responsibilities go to the best mind' while more capable hands manage the day-to-day work.<br />But this kind of freedom is not only allowed, but demanded - those who are used to simply being told what to do, who are incapable of directing themselves and challenging existing views, will have trouble meeting the extremely high standards of INTJs. Effectiveness and results are paramount for INTJs, and behaviors that sabotage these conditions are mercilessly suppressed. If subordinates try to compensate for weaknesses in these aspects by trying to socialize with INTJ managers, they will fail miserably—office gossip and flattery are not the right ways to approach INTJs—only skill prominent achieves this.</p>",

  "INFJintro":"<p>The INFJ personality type is very rare, accounting for less than one percent of the population, but they make their mark on the world nonetheless. As members of the Diplomat group, they have an innate sense of idealism and morals, but what sets them apart from others is that they are not mere dreamers. They are capable of realizing their goals and making a lasting positive impact. <br />INFJs see helping their others as their purpose in life. While people with this personality type can be found trying to save others and doing charity work, their true passion is getting to the root of the problem so that people don't have need to be saved altogether. <br /><strong>Help me help you</strong> <br />True INFJs have a unique combination of traits: although they are soft-spoken, they have strong opinions and will fight tirelessly for a idea they believe in. They are confident and determined, but rarely use this for personal gain - INFJs will act with creativity, imagination, conviction and sensitivity, not to create advantage but balance. Equality and karma are two very attractive ideas to them, and they believe that nothing helps the world more than using love and mercy to soften the hearts of tyrants.</p><blockquote><p><br />Every person should decide whether to walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. <br />Martin Luther King</p></blockquote><p><br />INFJs find it easy to connect with others and have a special talent for warm, sensitive language, speak in humane terms rather than logic and facts. it's understandable why friends and colleagues would see them as extroverted types, but they don't forget that INFJs need to be alone to 'recharge their batteries' so don't be alarmed if they suddenly withdraw from social life. INFJs care about other people's feelings and expect that in return – sometimes that means expecting them to be left alone in their own space for a few days. <br /><strong>Live to fight another day</strong> <br />In fact, it is most important for INFJs to remember to take care of themselves as well. The passion of their convictions is capable of sending them beyond their critical point and if their devotion gets out of control they feel exhausted, unhealthy and stressed. This becomes especially evident when INFJs have to deal with conflict and criticism - their sensitivity drives them to do everything they can to avoid these seemingly personal attacks. However, when situations are unavoidable, they respond to the attack in truly irrational ways. <br />For INFJs, the world is a place filled with injustice - but it doesn't have to be. No other personality type is better suited to create justice. INFJs just need to remember that while they are busy protecting the world, they also need to take care of themselves.</p>",
  "INFJweaknessAndForces":"<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses </h2><h3><br />Strengths</h3><p><br /><strong>Creative -</strong> Combining a developed imagination with a strong sense of compassion, INFJs use their creativity to solve human issues rather than technical challenges. People with this personality type enjoy finding the perfect solution for the people they love, and this quality makes them they make great counselors. <br /><strong>Intelligent –</strong> See beyond deceitful and dishonest intentions, so they move from manipulation and underhand tactics to an honest approach. INFJs see how people are connected with events and are able to use this knowledge to get to the heart of the matter.<br /><strong>Inspiring and Persuasive –</strong> As they speak in human terms, not technical, INFJs have a way of writing inspirational that lures idealists into their audience. They can also be really great orators, speaking with warmth and passion when they feel proud of what they are saying.<br /><strong>Decided -</strong> Creativity their insight and inspiration have a real impact on the world because INFJs follow through on their ideas with conviction, willpower, and the planning necessary for complex projects. They not only see how things should be, but also act on this knowledge. <br /><strong>Unyielding and passionate –</strong> When INFJs believe something is important they pursue that goal with a conviction and energy that can surprise even their friends and relatives. theirs. INFJs will move mountains if need be, something not everyone likes to see, but passion for their chosen cause is an integral part of their personality. <br /><strong>Altruistic -</strong> These qualities are used for good.

People with this personality are knowledgeable and have a lot of respect for those who give them attention in this matter. They will gladly help deal with dilemmas by offering advice and rational solutions. However, as valuable as these qualities are, they are not always the best way - when it comes to emotional support or advice about feelings they are a lost cause.</p><p>It's not that INTPs don't feel - quite on the contrary, they actually have very strong feelings. But this is not their strong point, making their emotional reactions powerful, unreliable and of course needing to be accompanied by their well-trained logic and rationalism.</p><p><strong> …But when the friendship is established, it continues safely and continuously</strong></p><p>While they may not be able to help directly with these kinds of problems, INTPs help indirectly with trusting friendships.

INTP parents approach children in a relaxed and intellectual way, allowing them to explore the world around them and see beyond the small obstacles that get in their way.</p><p>Reluctant to exercise control over other human beings, INTPs tend to let children make up their own principles—although they may take advantage of the 'why?' to present their perspectives and ideas, if needed.</p><p>INTPs are not particularly demanding parents, at least not in terms of expecting their children to live a traditional life: school > career > marriage > home > children > retirement (this time, thank you very much).Instead, parental INTPs are intellectually demanding—they want their children to question whether this is the best path for them. them and how to follow a different path if they have to. This level of personal freedom can be scary and take a long time to accept, however they are willing to stand by their children with support and advice for that long. as much as they need.</p><p>While it's hard to find parents better at having rational discussions with children, it's also hard to find a more clumsy example when it comes to the emotional support children need. especially as they approach their teenage years. In this area, INTPs must either rely on a more sensitive partner or step out of their comfort zone in order to become empathetic without trying to wipe away tears with an endless series of rational suggestions and bitter truths.</p><p><strong>Not just life, but good life </strong></p><p>INTPs want nothing more than their children grow wise, independent and tolerant. Their parenting style provides a great deal of freedom for children, but with that freedom comes responsibility, and it's the INTP's job to make sure it's being put to good use.

INTPs have quite a bit of trouble finding occupations that suit them, but what they do offer, qualities in higher demand, are creativity, a passion for theoretical methods and ideas, and an innovative spirit.

There are many other professions that allow INTPs to explore these interests, but many of them are deeply rooted in uninteresting practical applications.</p><p>This personality is motivated and has very high personal standards - “enough 'good' is never good enough - but they have few demands on the environment around them. Despite this relative simplicity, they are often difficult for more sociable people to understand. INTPs live primarily in their heads and have little interest in social distractions like pep talks and motivational speeches.</p><p>All INTPs really want is to get involved in an interesting project and anything that stands in the way of that, whether those very active managers, the need to manage others, holidays or work meetings, are simply unwanted burdens.</p><p>For this reason, the less hierarchy in the workplace, the better, making small, technical jobs and fields such as law, forensics, and laboratory research highly desirable for INTPs.

This personality finds it difficult to understand the emotional state and service positions will be tiring for them. Although INTPs are gifted analysts able to understand the theoretical importance of customer service, the day-to-day application of this schema is best left to personalities who are sociable. </p><p>Business is becoming more complex every day and this complexity is managed with technical systems, economic theory and data. The need for a new kind of approach to stand out from the crowd is greater than ever for people and organizations. Although general people skills are often seen as a must, it's the technical work that creates something that gets people talking and is the area where INTPs excel. </p><p>Working as business analysts and corporate strategists is well suited for INTPs, but they can also push things forward as data analysts, mechanical, electronic, and programming engineers, and even even as technical writers and journalists, if the field is interesting enough. If they can smile and shake hands long enough to present themselves as the brilliant innovators that they are, people with this personality type will realize that despite the expectations of social norms, it's the unique qualities that are really being sought after.</p>",
  "INTPworkPlace":"<h2><strong>INTPs in the Workplace </strong></h2><p>A recurring theme for INTPs is their desire for solitude, their need for intellectual stimulation, and their enjoyment of finding the final piece of a puzzle. Whether in managerial or subordinate positions, with colleagues or working alone, these privileges and the freedom to pursue them without being hindered by social obligations and progress reports are what INTPs seek in a workplace.</p><p>Although INTPs may scoff at the idea, they work best when paired with another person. Their position determines which personality suits them best, but the tendency of INTPs to live in their heads and unleash inspiration and creativity on occasion require the presence of an enforcer to ensure that no genius effort goes undictated.</p><p></p> <p><strong>INTPs as underlings</strong></p><p>Under the right conditions, underling INTPs are innovative, resourceful and hard-working, easily engaging in any complex problem set before them and provide unusual but effective solutions. However, these qualities require a lot of freedom, something that typical managers are loathe to give. it is difficult to quantify these qualities in a resume - some other characteristics, such as the relative indifference to being liked and job security cause fear - and it takes time to allow yourself this freedom.</p><p>INTP- they prefer to work alone, but at the same time they hate a simple job. Their focus on creating new and exciting ideas and ignoring the details of execution means they need someone nearby to keep order and put INTPs' often crude ideas into practice. This condition cannot be imposed on INTPs, but logically expressed criticism (certainly not emotional talk or group work speeches) and wise management can achieve this.</p><p><strong>INTP- as colleagues </strong></p><p>For INTPs colleagues are not a group of people to hang out with and work with so much as a series of distractions and distractions with occasionally useful knowledge. Mingling with others, conversations and drinks after work - these make INTPs want to work alone, not wake up in the morning. Despite this distance, people with this personality type are extremely good at unbiased interpretations of other people's motives, although they sometimes overdo it, becoming suspicious of others' intentions.</p><p>What they likes are riddles, structures, and any INTP would be proud to be a guru who goes after the validity of an idea or their insight into how to apply principles to new situations. INTPs love to discuss theories, at least with wise colleagues, and are almost always ready as impromptu advisors. This, however, does not apply to emotional conflicts, their Achilles heel - in these situations INTPs have no idea what to do.</p><p><strong>INTPs as managers</strong></p><p>While INTPs are not interested in managing other people, it is likely the most rewarding position because it allows them to lead concepts and theories while others handle logistics. INTPs have a fairly flexible and tolerant style, characterized by an openness to logical suggestions and relative freedom for their subordinates. But this freedom comes at a cost—managerial INTPs have very high standards and expect others to pick up on their insight immediately and offer their help in equal measure.</p><p>Like their demand for innovation, INTPs are better than any other personality at picking up on disagreements—their tendency to ignore the feelings of others means they're often harsh and quick to criticize because they run projects to their own perfectionist standards. Here again they work better with a partner, this time a delegate who can moderate their thoughts and lead the team in a more socially productive way. A friendship can help avoid gossip and attempts at emotional manipulation.</p>",
